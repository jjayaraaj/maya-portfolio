        <div class="work-title">Driving Change through Iterative A/B Experimentation</div>

        <p>In my 8 months with the PLG team, we conducted numerous A/B experiments. While I've focused on three key
            experiments for this case study, there were many more worth discussing. Here's our approach after each
            experiment:</p>

        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
            <li><span class="font-bold">User-Centric Approach:</span> After each experiment, we meticulously evaluated
                the results and observed user
                interactions through FullStory.</li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">Iterative Refinement:</span> We used the insights from these experiments,
                coupled with user feedback, to
            <li>iteratively improve our solutions.</li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">Rollout Decisions:</span> Decisions to implement changes to a broader user base
                were based on the data-driven
                insights we gained.</li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">Continuous Problem-Solving:</span> This iterative process continuously guides us
                in identifying the next
                challenge
                to tackle.</li>

            <p class=" text-gray-on-black">Indeed, PLG should be a foundational mindset when approaching
                problem-solving. A product or feature that's user-friendly and easy to set up leaves a lasting impact,
                fostering both user growth and retention. In today's tech-driven landscape, a self-serve product offers
                a substantial market advantage, enabling it to essentially sell itself. My experience with the PLG team
                has instilled this mindset in me, and I've carried it forward into other projects.</p>
