                        <p>I’m from Chennai, holds a special place in my heart – it's where my story began. CSK FTW!
                        </p>
                        <p>When I'm not crafting user experiences, I'm either channeling my inner artist through
                            painting,
                            diving into badminton games, or pumping iron at the gym.</p>
                        <p>Married for three years to my awesome partner, we're a dynamic duo with a shared passion for
                            Arsenal (his influence, totally!). Vrooming around on test drives is our couple's therapy,
                            and
                            we're known for hosting epic board game nights. Fancy a challenge in Catan? I'm your go-to
                            strategist.</p>
                        <p>My leisure hours are a marathon of anime and TV show binges - who needs coffee or tea when
                            you've
                            got drama and fantasy? As a self-confessed foodie with a sweet tooth, I'm always up for
                            culinary
                            experiments - be it in my kitchen or going out to the newest restaurant in the city.</p>
                        <p>So, if you're looking for a designer who brings a dash of play, a sprinkle of creativity, and
                            a
                            heap of user-focused brilliance, you've just found her! Let's make something extraordinary
                            together.</p>
